Got News Api/ Covid Api working 
-Next time: News api has 2 different fields rn which means 2 diff api calls and I need to store each api call in an array within the user
Figure out if there is a possibility of having several api calls and for those, I need an arrayList holding the calls being made

In news ended up getting rid of :
private void setButtons(String[] s){
        
        for(int i = 0; i<s.length; i++){
            buttons[i].setText(s[i]);
        }
        if(s.length<buttons.length){
            int remainder = buttons.length - s.length;
            for(int i= buttons.length-1; i>buttons.length-remainder-1; i--){
                buttons[i].setEnabled(false);
                buttons[i].setVisible(false);
            }
        }
    }
    
    //ArrayList<NewsConnection> news
    private void setStories(JToggleButton btn){
        if(btn.isSelected()){
         this.updateButtons(btn);
         String topic = btn.getText();
         for(int i=0; i<news.size(); i++){
             //news => list of news connections
             if(news.get(i).getSection()==topic){
                 for(int j =0; j<stories.length; i++){
                     stories[j].setText(news.get(i).getStories().get(i).toString());
                 }
             }
         }
     }
    }
It was causing issues that I think could be avoided if I make the window hold all of the values
