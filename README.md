# dashboard-final
This is a Final project using java along with several Apis. The idea of this application is to have a customized location that displays different information that you can
look at while you are at work. It is meant to be a companion application. There is a ton of customability. the Apis that I used were to help get Covid-19 information, weather,news
,as well as stock information
